					<h3><i>Dyslexia the challenge !</i></h3>
					<p><i>The reason I am sharing this story is because I still see that people are surprised that you can have a degree and be dyslexic.From my experience I found that people with  dylexia if given	proper attention can succeed like any normal person.You just have to find the right resources and give proper training...that's all :)
						My son was 8 when we found out that he was dyslexic.He struggled at school from the offset. I remember distinctly when I tried showing flashcards to him and him having absolutely no idea that there was a link between the sounds of words and the writings on the card. Responses from teachers ranged from well meaning to plain nasty. One teacher who gave him hell when he was 7, called me to tell how lazy he was and showed his ‘horrible’ work to the class.I remember how upset he was on that day...It took me and my husband a few days to cheer him up.
					</i></p>
					<p><i>By the time he was 8, some teachers started suggesting that he might be dyslexic and that was when we took him to be informally assessed.The assessor confirmed that he had dyslexia and that it was the sole reason why he had dificulty reading and pronouncing.Then I researched a lot about dyslexia, asked many people about it and found that all he needed was some extra attention. So me and my husband, we decided that we give more attention to his studies.So I started stting with him when he was studying and tried to make him understand the meaning of words through	pictures and make him understand the pronounciation of words with the help of a technique I learned through a Youtube video.It went well,he started to get the knack of it and learning 
						became more interesting for him.
					</i></p>
					<p><i>But when he turned 9, we encountered a financial problem because my husband's company broke.He was having a hard time in the office and he ended up having debts to a number of people.At this time I decided to take extra shifts in the hospital I work inorder to pay all our debts. As a result I couldn't pay attention to my son's studies and I found that again some of the teachers started scolding him and he was becoming more upset than ever. During this time we couldn't afford to send him to a tuition as all the money that we were getting was used to pay the debts. Seeing my son's state,I decided to find something helpful for him, any free resources through which he could learn on his own. And that was when I found about the app named 'Infinity'.This app contains various exercises which helps the child to learn how to write alphabets without mistake and about the pronunciation of words.Since it is in the format of a game I thought that my son would definitely be interested since he liked to take up challenges. And when I introduced the app to my son, it was like I thought, loved it and started spending time	on the app. Each day when we came home I remember how excited he used to get to tell me about how many challenges he solved that day. The app makes the children learn without them knowing through various exercises.Another good feature of Infinity is that it has an online website where I could login and monitor my son's education.I got information abouthow much he has improved 
						over the use of the app.</i></p>
					<p><i>Today, I am very happy to say that he is 14 and he does not have any difficulty recognising alphabets/numbers or phonetics.And he is able to hang out with other students more confidently. So I strongly recommend this app for anyone who hasn't tried it as in this modern world where both the parents are working, the parents won't normally have time to sit with their children	while studying. Also, I suggest that if the parents itself can sit with their children it will always be better. Dyslexia is nothing to be afraid of, always the children will be able to overcome it,given the right resources and attention.Put yourself in their shoes and try to help them in every possible way. Figure out what you can do as a team, and be there for each other. Their potential will astound you!</i></p>
